> Build your app on Release scheme to test for production


#### Test your application in production mode to make sure that everything works as planned. When you build your application in Xcode, it's set by default in Debug mode. You can test for Release on the Simulator by easily editing your scheme.


To do so, in Xcode, at the top, click on your scheme.

Then, you'll need to go to the bottom of the list, where you'll select the **Edit Scheme**... option.

A window will open up and under **Build Configuration**, you'll be able to change it to **Release**. You can now build your app for **Release** and test your app in production mode.
